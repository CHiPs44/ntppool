Hi [% admin.email %],

This is an automated email.

The NTP Pool system has marked your timeserver as either unreachable
or keeping bad time.  Until the issue has been addressed, it will not
be included in the pool.ntp.org DNS zones.

If you have resolved the problem or if it has resolved itself, there's
no need to reply to this email - the monitoring system will notice and
after a short time include the server in the system again.

(You can follow the status on the URL listed next to the server IP).

The NTP system is based on IPs rather than the DNS of your server. If
the IP changes it is considered a new server. You can schedule the old
IP for removal and add the new one on the management web site:
   [% config.base_url('manage') %]

[% FILTER repeat(70) %]-[% END %]
[%- FOR server = bad_servers %]
[% server.ip %] (current score: [% server.score %])  [% config.base_url('ntppool') %]/s/[% server.id %]
[%- END %]
[% FILTER repeat(70) %]-[% END %]

You can see the stats for all your servers in the pool at 
    [% config.base_url('manage') %]/manage

If you haven't logged in for a long time, you might need to
recreate your account after our login system upgrade in 2016:
    https://news.ntppool.org/2016/04/login-upgrade/

If you need help troubleshooting, the NTP Pool community at
https://community.ntppool.org/ is very helpful.

If you have any questions, just reply to this email. Otherwise no
response is necessary.

Thank you for offering your NTP service to the pool!
