Hi [% admin.email %],

Due to unresolved problems with your timeserver it is being removed
from the NTP Pool (pool.ntp.org) project.

Server IP: [% server.ip %][% IF server.hostname %] ([% server.hostname %])[% END %]

The server has been scheduled for removal on [% server.deletion_on.strftime("%B %d, %Y") %].

If you perceive this to be in error (or fixed the server problem) and
want to add the server to the project again, please go to
[% config.base_url('manage') %]/manage to use the automated system
to re-add the server.

If you need help troubleshooting, the NTP Pool community at
https://community.ntppool.org/ is very helpful, or you can reply
to this email and our small team of volunteers will try to help.

If you haven't logged in for a long time, you might need to
recreate your account after our login system upgrade in 2016:
